The open source finite element library deal.II was used in our program, one can git it from 
https://www.dealii.org/. The program requires the deal.II version 9.0.0 or later.

To use this program, first, one should go to the tdip3d-master directory and type

mkdir build
cd build

Second, the following commands can help you to  generate an executable file "tdip3d".

cmake -DCMAKE_TPYE_BUILD=Release -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/deal.II ..   #  for release
or  cmake -DCMAKE_TPYE_BUILD=Debug -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/deal.II ..  #  for debug
make

Finial, you shuold have three configuration files *.mdlï¼Œ*.emd, *.prm, and go to the tdip3d-master
directory and type

./tdip3d  *.prm


Under our "model" directoty "test01" and "test02" are the simple example, and the others 
correspond to the models used in our manuscript.
